# TripShare API
This is the back-end API application for TripShare. It is written using [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) persistance layer.

## Running Locally
To run TripShare API locally, please have [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm) installed on your machine. Once installed, execute the following commands:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

If you would like to interact with TripShare API through a UI, please see the [TripShare UI](https://github.com/Mark-Donohue/tripshare-ui) project for instructions on how to set up and run a UI instance locally.
